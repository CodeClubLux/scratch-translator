A Web interface that helps you translate the Scratch blocks in the the Code Club curriculums (https://github.com/CodeClub/scratch-curriculum/)

The current version is installed here: http://michel.weimerskirch.net/scratch-translator/

It's far from being perfect. It was a one hour project which turned into a three hour project. But it already turned out to be helpful.

How to add a language?

* Go to http://translate.scratch.mit.edu/projects/scratch1.4/
* Select your language
* Go to the review tab
* Download the .po file and save it to the "languages" folder
* Add an "*.additional" file with additional texts not found in the original file
